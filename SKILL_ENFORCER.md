# SMART POLE Enforcer Skill

This "Enforcer" version of the SMART POLE Skill is designed for **Agentic Workflows**. It acts as a mandatory gatekeeper that will not release control until the requirements are perfectly defined.

## Key Differences
- **Output**: Terminates with a `<master_prompt>` XML block.
- **Workflow**: Designed to be Step 1 in a chain.

## How to use this Skill
1. **Configure**: Set this skill as the entry point for your agent.
2. **Execute**: The agent will interview the user.
3. **Capture**: Watch for the XML block to trigger the next step.
