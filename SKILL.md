# SMART POLE Instructor Skill

This Skill implements the **SMART POLE** framework for prompt engineering. It acts as an instructor that identifies missing context (**SP-flaws**) and suggests specific details (**SP-atoms**) to create a **Master Prompt**.

## How to use this Skill

1. **Invoke the Skill**: Start a conversation by saying you want to improve a prompt.
2. **Provide your Prompt**: Paste the vague or draft prompt you have.
3. **Receive Analysis**: The Skill will list the **SP-flaws** (missing categories).
4. **Iterate**: Answer the questions or add the atoms suggested.
5. **Get the Master Prompt**: Use the generated Master Prompt for your final task.

- **Category (A)**: Is the goal to lose weight or build muscle?
- **Category (T)**: Is this for a week or a lifetime?
