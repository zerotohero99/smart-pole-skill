# Logic of the SMART POLE Framework

The SMART POLE framework is designed to eliminate the "guessing" that AI does when faced with vague context. By breaking down "context" into 9 distinct categories, we ensure every "atom" of information is placed exactly where the AI can process it most efficiently.

## Deep Dive into Categories

### 1. S - Style (The AI's Mask)
- **Concept**: The persona the AI wears.
- **Atoms**: "Cynical noir," "Helpful tutor," "Academic paper."
- **Logic**: Sets the vocabulary and syntactic structure of the *response*.
- **God-tier (The Persuasion Scalpel)**: Embed Cialdini's Principles:
  - *Authority*: Cite technical jargon to establish expertise.
  - *Social Proof*: "10,000 users already pre-ordered."
  - *Unity*: Use "we" language for tribal belonging.
- **Persona Specificity**: Not "Be a salesperson" → "Be a **Tech-Evangelist** who is visibly excited."

### 2. M - Mastery (The User's Level)
- **Concept**: Who is the user? What is their cognitive load capacity?
- **Atoms**: "Senior Architect (High context)," "5-year-old child (Low context)," "Intermediate knitter."
- **Logic**: Prevents "average" explanations by locking into a specific expertise tier for the *explanation*.

### 3. A - Aim (The Objective & Scorecard)
- **Concept**: The specific result and how it will be judged.
- **Atoms**: "Persuade a skeptic," "Summarize for a CEO," "Success = User feels confident."
- **Logic**: Gives the AI a success metric and evaluation criteria.

### 4. R - Resource (The Toolbox)
- **Concept**: What does the AI have to work with?
- **Atoms**: "Use only the attached PDF," "Budget: $0," "Equipment: One laptop."
- **Logic**: Prevents the AI from suggesting impossible or irrelevant solutions.
- **God-tier (The Constraint Clamp)**: Include **Negative Atoms** (what is NOT allowed).
  - *Positive*: "Budget: $500, Tools: CapCut free."
  - *Negative*: "**NO** CGI, **NO** paid ads, **NO** professional studio."
- **Why**: Stops AI from suggesting "pie-in-the-sky" solutions you can't execute.

### 5. T - Time (The Schedule/Era)
- **Concept**: When is this happening, or how long should it take?
- **Atoms**: "Set in 1920s Paris," "Deadline: 2 hours," "Duration: 5-minute read."
- **Logic**: Grounds the response in a temporal context.

### 6. P - People (The Human Variable)
- **Concept**: Who is this for? What do they value? What are their internal beliefs?
- **Atoms**: "Audience: Busy parents," "Value: Efficiency over cost," "Persona: Introverted," "Belief: Sustainability is key."
- **Logic**: Adjusts the empathy and focus of the response to match the user's worldview.

### 7. O - Outline (The Skeleton & Scope)
- **Concept**: The structural constraints and what to *exclude*.
- **Atoms**: "3 acts," "Bullet points followed by a table," "Ignore backyard gardens," "Focus only on balcony."
- **Logic**: Controls the layout and density of the information.

### 8. L - Locale (The Setting)
- **Concept**: The physical or conceptual environment, broken down into 4 sub-dimensions:
    - **L1 - Industry/Domain**: Banking, Healthcare, E-commerce, etc.
    - **L2 - Geography/Region**: Vietnam, EU, USA, etc.
    - **L3 - Legal/Regulatory**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS.
    - **L4 - Cultural/Social**: Local customs, user behavior norms.

- **Priority Logic**: The importance of these 4 dimensions shifts based on the Industry context.
    - **Banking**: Legal (L3) > Industry (L1) > Geo (L2) > Cultural (L4).
    - **Healthcare**: Legal (L3) > Industry (L1) > Cultural (L4) > Geo (L2).
    - **E-commerce**: Cultural (L4) > Geo (L2) > Industry (L1) > Legal (L3).
    - *General Rule*: Industry > Geo > Cultural > Legal.
    
- **Logic**: Ensures the advice is not just "technically" correct but "contextually" viable.
- **God-tier (The Cultural Microscope)**: Drill down to **Sub-cultures** and niche markets.
  - *Basic*: "Vietnam" → *God-tier*: "Facebook 'Nghiện Setup' community, hate 'lùa gà', value authenticity."
- **Specialized Language**: Include domain slang (e.g., Gen Z keyboard terms: 'lube', 'mod', 'stab').

### 9. E - Example (The Anchor)
- **Concept**: A reference point for the AI to follow.
- **Insight**: **Snippet Power > Name Dropping**. It is better to provide a concrete 3-line example than to say "Write like Shakespeare."
- **Atoms**: "Use this JSON schema: {...}", "Structure like this paragraph: [Quote]".
- **Logic**: Provides a "one-shot" or "few-shot" pattern for the AI to emulate.
- **God-tier (The DNA Template)**: Provide both **Positive Examples** AND **Anti-Examples**.
  - *Positive*: "Write like this snippet: [good example]."
  - *Anti-Example*: "**DO NOT** write like this: [cringe example]. I hate this style."
- **Why**: AI is excellent at mimicking, but even better at avoiding if you name the enemy.


## The SP-Atom Principle
A prompt is not a block of text; it is a collection of **Atoms**. 
- An atom is **indivisible context**. 
- Adding an atom **decreases entropy** (uncertainty).
- Removing an atom **increases guesswork**.

## The SP-Flaw Principle
A flaw is an "empty bucket". If you don't fill the "Resource" bucket, the AI will reach into its general training data and grab a random resource. This leads to hallucinations or generic advice.

## Weighted Readiness Scoring (v3.0)
To scientifically measure prompt quality, we assign weights to categories based on their impact:

| Category | Weight | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Aim / Outline** | **2.0** | **CORE**: Without these, the request is structureless. |
| **Locale** | **CONDITIONAL** | **CORE (2.0)** for Advisory/Discovery, **1.5** for Generative, **0.5** for Deterministic |
| **People / Mastery / Resource** | **1.5 / 1.0** | **CONTEXTUALIZER**: Defines the constraints and flavor. |
| **Time / Style / Example** | **0.5** | **ACCELERATOR**: Enhances quality but not mandatory for logic. |

### Task-Type Classification
The system automatically classifies requests into 5 types:

| Task Type | Keywords | Locale Requirement |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Deterministic** | solve, calculate, algorithm, parse | Optional (0.5) |
| **Generative** | write, create, design, build | Contextualizer (1.5) |
| **Advisory** | advise, recommend, should I, strategy | 🔴 **CORE (2.0)** |
| **Discovery** | brainstorm, explore, ideas, research | 🔴 **CORE (2.0)** |
| **Compliance** | legal, policy, GDPR, regulation | 🔴 **CORE (2.0)** |

**Threshold**: A prompt is considered "Master/Gemini-Ready" only when it achieves a score of **≥ 67%** AND all required Core categories are confirmed.

## Atom Granularity (v3.0)
An SP-atom must be **indivisible** and formatted as: `Category: Sub-type - Specific value`.

| ❌ Too vague | ✅ Granular atom |
|--------------|------------------|
| "Style is professional" | `Style: Tone - Formal business English` |
| "Use Reciprocity" | `Style: Persuasion strategy - Reciprocity (cite past favor)` |
| "For beginners" | `Mastery: Skill level - Complete novice, no prior exposure` |

## Consequence Linking (v3.0)
When identifying SP-flaws, always state the **technical consequence** if the flaw is left unfilled.

**Template**:
> ⚠️ **SP-flaw (X)**: [What's missing]. 
> 🔻 **If unfilled**: [What AI will do wrong / What user will lose].

## Aim vs Outline Distinction (v3.0)
These two categories are often confused. Here's the clear distinction:

| Aspect | Outline (O) | Aim (A) |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Nature** | Technical specs | Desired outcome |
| **Examples** | Word count, sections, format | Convince, inform, comfort |
| **Metaphor** | The **hard frame** | The **destination** |

*Example*: "Email under 100 words" = Outline. "Email must make boss feel reassured" = Aim.
