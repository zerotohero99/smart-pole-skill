## ✅ Verification Checklist

After updating your Gem, test with these prompts:

### Test 1: Deterministic Task (No domain question expected)
```
"Calculate the sum of 1 to 100"
```
✅ Should NOT ask for domain

### Test 2: Advisory Task (Domain question expected)
```
"Recommend a marketing strategy for my business"
```
✅ Should ask:
- What industry?
- Which region?
- Any regulations?

### Test 3: Discovery Task (Domain question expected)
```
"Brainstorm ideas for improving customer retention"
```
✅ Should ask for Industry/Domain first

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Gem doesn't ask for domain
**Solution**: Ensure Task-Type Classification section is included

### Issue 2: Locale not treated as Core
**Solution**: Ensure Locale Conditional Core Rule is present

### Issue 3: Wrong max score
**Solution**: Update to dynamic max score (9.5/10.5/11.0)
